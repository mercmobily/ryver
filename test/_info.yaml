# postProcessFilters should have the last filters to be applied.
# Some filters will set the `delayPostProcess` flag for some files in their
# fileInfo. In this case, postProcessFilters will only be applied only once
# _all_ files had _all_ the filters above
# applied. This makes it possible to have filters like `lister` that will
# gather information about files, and then `lister-vars` which will make
# variables available when information about _all_ files are needed (e.g.
# the latest 10 posts for specific tags or categories).
