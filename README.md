# ryver

Ryver is a simple, filter-based static file generator with Node.js.
Mainly created out of my sheer desire of starting _and_ finishing something, after more that 3 years of developing [Hotplate](https://github.com/mercmobily/hotplate) -- as well as my need to convert several existing web sites to static ones.

Ryver is currently being documented. Also, unit-testing hasn't been done (yet)
